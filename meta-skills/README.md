# Meta-Skills

This directory contains meta-skills that orchestrate multiple skills and MCPs to accomplish complex project workflows.

## Contents

Add meta-skills here. These are higher-level orchestration skills that combine other capabilities.

## Usage

Each meta-skill should have its own subdirectory with a README.md explaining:
- What skills and MCPs it orchestrates
- How to configure and use it
- Example workflows
